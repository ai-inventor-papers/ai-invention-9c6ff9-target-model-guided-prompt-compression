<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Target-Model-Guided Prompt Compression via Attention Saliency
hypothesis: >-
  Using the target LLM's own attention-saliency maps or gradient-based input attribution (e.g., integrated gradients, attention
  rollout) to select which prompt tokens to retain will outperform proxy-model-based compression (LLMLingua, LongLLMLingua,
  LLMLingua-2) because it directly captures what the target model actually uses for generation, rather than what a small proxy
  model thinks is important.
motivation: >-
  All existing prompt compression methods (LLMLingua, LongLLMLingua, LLMLingua-2, Selective-Context, PCRL, Perception Compressor)
  use a SMALL PROXY MODEL (GPT-2, LLaMA-7B, BERT, etc.) to estimate token importance. This creates a distribution mismatch:
  the proxy model's notion of 'important tokens' may not match what the actual target LLM attends to during generation. By
  using the target model's own attention or gradient-based saliency, we directly measure what the target model uses, eliminating
  the proxy gap. This is especially impactful for open models (LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen) where we have full white-box access to
  attention maps.
assumptions:
- >-
  The target LLM's attention patterns or input gradients correlate with token importance for the downstream task
- >-
  White-box access to the target model is available (open-weight models like LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen)
- >-
  Attention-saliency can be computed efficiently (single forward pass or few backward passes) relative to the compression
  budget
- >-
  The target model's attention on the prompt tokens is stable across similar prompts/tasks (enabling caching or reuse)
investigation_approach: >-
  Implement a tiny experiment comparing three compression strategies on LongBench (single-doc QA, multi-doc QA, summarization)
  using LLaMA-3-8B as the target model: (1) LLMLingua (GPT-2 perplexity baseline), (2) LongLLMLingua (query-aware contrastive
  perplexity), (3) Target-Model-Guided: compute attention rollout or integrated gradients from the target model on a calibration
  set, use mean attention-to-prompt or gradient magnitude per token as importance score, compress by retaining top-k tokens.
  Measure F1/ROUGE vs compression ratio. Total compute: <1 GPU-hour on a single A100/H100.
success_criteria: >-
  Target-model-guided compression achieves higher task performance (F1 for QA, ROUGE for summarization) than LLMLingua and
  LongLLMLingua at the same compression ratios (2x, 4x, 8x) on at least 2 of 3 LongBench task categories. A null result (no
  improvement) would still be informative—it would suggest the proxy models already capture the target model's token importance
  well, or that attention-saliency is not the right signal.
related_works:
- >-
  LLMLingua (Jiang et al., EMNLP 2023): Uses GPT-2/LLaMA-7B perplexity as proxy for token importance. Fundamentally differs
  by using a small proxy model instead of the target model's own attention.
- >-
  LongLLMLingua (Jiang et al., ACL 2024): Adds query-awareness via contrastive perplexity (perplexity shift when conditioned
  on question). Still uses a proxy model (LLaMA-7B) for all importance estimates.
- >-
  LLMLingua-2 (Pan et al., ACL Findings 2024): Trains a BERT-based token classifier on GPT-4 distilled data. Task-agnostic,
  uses bidirectional context but still a proxy model (XLM-RoBERTa/mBERT), not the target LLM.
- >-
  Selective-Context (Li et al., 2023): Uses self-information from a small LM. Proxy-based, no query awareness.
- >-
  PCRL (Jung & Kim, 2023): RL-based discrete compression with ROUGE reward. Trains a policy on a small model (DistilBERT),
  not the target LLM.
- >-
  Perception Compressor (Tang et al., NAACL 2025): Training-free, uses guiding questions and contrast perplexity from a small
  LM. Still proxy-based.
- >-
  Attention-based KV cache compression (e.g., Keyformer, PyramidInfer): Uses target model attention to drop KV cache entries
  DURING generation, not for prompt compression BEFORE generation. Different problem setting.
inspiration: >-
  Cross-domain transfer from mechanistic interpretability (attribution patching, activation patching) and model compression
  (attention-guided pruning). In mechanistic interpretability, we routinely use the target model's own attention/activations
  to understand its behavior. In model compression (e.g., MiniLMv2, attention distillation), we use teacher model attention
  to guide student training. The novel move is applying target-model attention/attribution to PROMPT COMPRESSION (selecting
  input tokens) rather than model compression (selecting weights/heads) or KV cache compression (selecting past keys/values).
  This connects the interpretability insight 'the model tells you what it attends to' with the prompt compression problem
  'which input tokens matter'.
terms:
- term: Proxy model
  definition: >-
    A smaller, faster model (e.g., GPT-2, LLaMA-7B, BERT) used to estimate token importance for compressing prompts intended
    for a larger target LLM
- term: Target model
  definition: >-
    The actual LLM that will process the compressed prompt at inference time (e.g., LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, GPT-4)
- term: Attention rollout
  definition: >-
    A method to compute token-to-token attribution by recursively multiplying attention matrices across layers, showing how
    much each input token contributes to each output token
- term: Integrated gradients
  definition: >-
    A gradient-based attribution method that integrates gradients along a straight-line path from a baseline input to the
    actual input, providing token-level importance scores
- term: Attention-saliency map
  definition: >-
    A per-token importance score derived from the target model's attention patterns, e.g., mean attention received by each
    prompt token across heads and layers
- term: Contrastive perplexity
  definition: >-
    LongLLMLingua's metric: perplexity(token | context) - perplexity(token | question, context), measuring how much the question
    reduces uncertainty about a token
summary: >-
  Current prompt compression methods all rely on small proxy models to decide which tokens to keep. This hypothesis proposes
  using the target LLM's own attention-saliency or gradient-based input attribution directly—measuring what the target model
  actually attends to—eliminating the proxy gap. Tiny experiments on LongBench with LLaMA-3-8B can validate this in <1 GPU-hour.
alternates:
- title: Calibration-Set Attention Distillation
  hypothesis: >-
    Instead of computing attention per-query, pre-compute a universal token-importance profile for the target model on a small
    calibration set (e.g., 100 diverse prompts), then use this static profile for all future compressions. This amortizes
    the white-box cost and tests whether the target model has consistent attention patterns across tasks.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If the target model's attention-to-prompt-tokens is relatively stable across tasks (e.g., always attends to instructions,
    entity names, question words), a one-time calibration suffices. This would be dramatically faster than per-query attribution
    and more practical for production. It beats the main hypothesis if per-query computation is the bottleneck and attention
    patterns are task-invariant.
- title: Hybrid Proxy-Target Compression
  hypothesis: >-
    Use the proxy model (e.g., LLMLingua-2) for coarse-grained document/sentence selection (cheap, fast), then apply target-model
    attention-saliency only for fine-grained token selection within the retained segments. This combines the efficiency of
    proxy models with the accuracy of target-model guidance.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    Pure target-model attribution on 10k-token prompts may be slow. Coarse proxy filtering reduces the token budget for expensive
    target-model attribution. This beats the main hypothesis if the compute budget is tight and coarse proxy decisions are
    already near-optimal, leaving only fine-grained selection to benefit from target-model signals.
- title: Gradient-Free Attention Sinks for Black-Box Target Models
  hypothesis: >-
    For API-only target models (no white-box access), use the 'attention sink' phenomenon (first few tokens accumulate disproportionate
    attention) as a proxy for the target model's internal attention: retain tokens that would become attention sinks (early
    instruction tokens, question tokens) and use a small proxy model for the rest.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    The main hypothesis requires white-box access. If the attention sink pattern is universal and predictable, we can approximate
    target-model attention without access. This beats the main hypothesis in black-box settings (OpenAI API, Anthropic API)
    where the main hypothesis is inapplicable. It wins if attention sinks reliably indicate target-model importance across
    diverse prompts.

objective: >-
  Execute the wide screen: run all 4 candidate methods on the LongBench mini-split, compute F1 (QA) and ROUGE-L (summarization)
  at 2x/4x/8x compression, produce ranked comparison with pre-registered selection rule.
approach: >-
  Implement a single evaluation harness that: (a) loads LLaMA-3-8B (4-bit quantized for memory) and all compression method
  implementations; (b) for each method and each compression ratio, compresses each mini-split example's prompt; (c) runs target
  model generation on compressed prompt; (d) computes F1 (exact match + token F1 for QA) and ROUGE-L (summarization); (e)

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

kind: hypothesis
title: Target-Model-Guided Prompt Compression via Attention Saliency
hypothesis: >-
  Using the target LLM's own attention-saliency maps or gradient-based input attribution (e.g., integrated gradients, attention
  rollout) to select which prompt tokens to retain will outperform proxy-model-based compression (LLMLingua, LongLLMLingua,
  LLMLingua-2) because it directly captures what the target model actually uses for generation, rather than what a small proxy
  model thinks is important.
motivation: >-
  All existing prompt compression methods (LLMLingua, LongLLMLingua, LLMLingua-2, Selective-Context, PCRL, Perception Compressor)
  use a SMALL PROXY MODEL (GPT-2, LLaMA-7B, BERT, etc.) to estimate token importance. This creates a distribution mismatch:
  the proxy model's notion of 'important tokens' may not match what the actual target LLM attends to during generation. By
  using the target model's own attention or gradient-based saliency, we directly measure what the target model uses, eliminating
  the proxy gap. This is especially impactful for open models (LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen) where we have full white-box access to
  attention maps.
assumptions:
- >-
  The target LLM's attention patterns or input gradients correlate with token importance for the downstream task
- >-
  White-box access to the target model is available (open-weight models like LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen)
- >-
  Attention-saliency can be computed efficiently (single forward pass or few backward passes) relative to the compression
  budget
- >-
  The target model's attention on the prompt tokens is stable across similar prompts/tasks (enabling caching or reuse)
investigation_approach: >-
  Implement a tiny experiment comparing three compression strategies on LongBench (single-doc QA, multi-doc QA, summarization)
  using LLaMA-3-8B as the target model: (1) LLMLingua (GPT-2 perplexity baseline), (2) LongLLMLingua (query-aware contrastive
  perplexity), (3) Target-Model-Guided: compute attention rollout or integrated gradients from the target model on a calibration
  set, use mean attention-to-prompt or gradient magnitude per token as importance score, compress by retaining top-k tokens.
  Measure F1/ROUGE vs compression ratio. Total compute: <1 GPU-hour on a single A100/H100.
success_criteria: >-
  Target-model-guided compression achieves higher task performance (F1 for QA, ROUGE for summarization) than LLMLingua and
  LongLLMLingua at the same compression ratios (2x, 4x, 8x) on at least 2 of 3 LongBench task categories. A null result (no
  improvement) would still be informative—it would suggest the proxy models already capture the target model's token importance
  well, or that attention-saliency is not the right signal.
related_works:
- >-
  LLMLingua (Jiang et al., EMNLP 2023): Uses GPT-2/LLaMA-7B perplexity as proxy for token importance. Fundamentally differs
  by using a small proxy model instead of the target model's own attention.
- >-
  LongLLMLingua (Jiang et al., ACL 2024): Adds query-awareness via contrastive perplexity (perplexity shift when conditioned
  on question). Still uses a proxy model (LLaMA-7B) for all importance estimates.
- >-
  LLMLingua-2 (Pan et al., ACL Findings 2024): Trains a BERT-based token classifier on GPT-4 distilled data. Task-agnostic,
  uses bidirectional context but still a proxy model (XLM-RoBERTa/mBERT), not the target LLM.
- >-
  Selective-Context (Li et al., 2023): Uses self-information from a small LM. Proxy-based, no query awareness.
- >-
  PCRL (Jung & Kim, 2023): RL-based discrete compression with ROUGE reward. Trains a policy on a small model (DistilBERT),
  not the target LLM.
- >-
  Perception Compressor (Tang et al., NAACL 2025): Training-free, uses guiding questions and contrast perplexity from a small
  LM. Still proxy-based.
- >-
  Attention-based KV cache compression (e.g., Keyformer, PyramidInfer): Uses target model attention to drop KV cache entries
  DURING generation, not for prompt compression BEFORE generation. Different problem setting.
inspiration: >-
  Cross-domain transfer from mechanistic interpretability (attribution patching, activation patching) and model compression
  (attention-guided pruning). In mechanistic interpretability, we routinely use the target model's own attention/activations
  to understand its behavior. In model compression (e.g., MiniLMv2, attention distillation), we use teacher model attention
  to guide student training. The novel move is applying target-model attention/attribution to PROMPT COMPRESSION (selecting
  input tokens) rather than model compression (selecting weights/heads) or KV cache compression (selecting past keys/values).
  This connects the interpretability insight 'the model tells you what it attends to' with the prompt compression problem
  'which input tokens matter'.

  definition: >-
    LongLLMLingua's metric: perplexity(token | context) - perplexity(token | question, context), measuring how much the question
    reduces uncertainty about a token
summary: >-
  Current prompt compression methods all rely on small proxy models to decide which tokens to keep. This hypothesis proposes
  using the target LLM's own attention-saliency or gradient-based input attribution directly—measuring what the target model
  actually attends to—eliminating the proxy gap. Tiny experiments on LongBench with LLaMA-3-8B can validate this in <1 GPU-hour.
alternates:
- title: Calibration-Set Attention Distillation
  hypothesis: >-
    Instead of computing attention per-query, pre-compute a universal token-importance profile for the target model on a small
    calibration set (e.g., 100 diverse prompts), then use this static profile for all future compressions. This amortizes
    the white-box cost and tests whether the target model has consistent attention patterns across tasks.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If the target model's attention-to-prompt-tokens is relatively stable across tasks (e.g., always attends to instructions,
    entity names, question words), a one-time calibration suffices. This would be dramatically faster than per-query attribution
    and more practical for production. It beats the main hypothesis if per-query computation is the bottleneck and attention
    patterns are task-invariant.
- title: Hybrid Proxy-Target Compression
  hypothesis: >-
    Use the proxy model (e.g., LLMLingua-2) for coarse-grained document/sentence selection (cheap, fast), then apply target-model
    attention-saliency only for fine-grained token selection within the retained segments. This combines the efficiency of
    proxy models with the accuracy of target-model guidance.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    Pure target-model attribution on 10k-token prompts may be slow. Coarse proxy filtering reduces the token budget for expensive
    target-model attribution. This beats the main hypothesis if the compute budget is tight and coarse proxy decisions are
    already near-optimal, leaving only fine-grained selection to benefit from target-model signals.
- title: Gradient-Free Attention Sinks for Black-Box Target Models
  hypothesis: >-
    For API-only target models (no white-box access), use the 'attention sink' phenomenon (first few tokens accumulate disproportionate
    attention) as a proxy for the target model's internal attention: retain tokens that would become attention sinks (early
    instruction tokens, question tokens) and use a small proxy model for the rest.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    The main hypothesis requires white-box access. If the attention sink pattern is universal and predictable, we can approximate
    target-model attention without access. This beats the main hypothesis in black-box settings (OpenAI API, Anthropic API)
    where the main hypothesis is inapplicable. It wins if attention sinks reliably indicate target-model importance across
    diverse prompts.

title: Target-Model-Guided Prompt Compression via Attention Saliency
hypothesis: >-
  Using the target LLM's own attention-saliency maps or gradient-based input attribution (e.g., integrated gradients, attention
  rollout) to select which prompt tokens to retain will outperform proxy-model-based compression (LLMLingua, LongLLMLingua,
  LLMLingua-2) because it directly captures what the target model actually uses for generation, rather than what a small proxy
  model thinks is important.
motivation: >-
  All existing prompt compression methods (LLMLingua, LongLLMLingua, LLMLingua-2, Selective-Context, PCRL, Perception Compressor)
  use a SMALL PROXY MODEL (GPT-2, LLaMA-7B, BERT, etc.) to estimate token importance. This creates a distribution mismatch:
  the proxy model's notion of 'important tokens' may not match what the actual target LLM attends to during generation. By
  using the target model's own attention or gradient-based saliency, we directly measure what the target model uses, eliminating
  the proxy gap. This is especially impactful for open models (LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen) where we have full white-box access to
  attention maps.
assumptions:
- >-
  The target LLM's attention patterns or input gradients correlate with token importance for the downstream task
- >-
  White-box access to the target model is available (open-weight models like LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen)
- >-
  Attention-saliency can be computed efficiently (single forward pass or few backward passes) relative to the compression
  budget
- >-
  The target model's attention on the prompt tokens is stable across similar prompts/tasks (enabling caching or reuse)
investigation_approach: >-
  Implement a tiny experiment comparing three compression strategies on LongBench (single-doc QA, multi-doc QA, summarization)
  using LLaMA-3-8B as the target model: (1) LLMLingua (GPT-2 perplexity baseline), (2) LongLLMLingua (query-aware contrastive
  perplexity), (3) Target-Model-Guided: compute attention rollout or integrated gradients from the target model on a calibration
  set, use mean attention-to-prompt or gradient magnitude per token as importance score, compress by retaining top-k tokens.
  Measure F1/ROUGE vs compression ratio. Total compute: <1 GPU-hour on a single A100/H100.
success_criteria: >-
  Target-model-guided compression achieves higher task performance (F1 for QA, ROUGE for summarization) than LLMLingua and
  LongLLMLingua at the same compression ratios (2x, 4x, 8x) on at least 2 of 3 LongBench task categories. A null result (no
  improvement) would still be informative—it would suggest the proxy models already capture the target model's token importance

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Target-Model-Guided Prompt Compression via Attention Saliency
hypothesis: >-
  Using the target LLM's own attention-saliency maps or gradient-based input attribution (e.g., integrated gradients, attention
  rollout) to select which prompt tokens to retain will outperform proxy-model-based compression (LLMLingua, LongLLMLingua,
  LLMLingua-2) because it directly captures what the target model actually uses for generation, rather than what a small proxy
  model thinks is important.
motivation: >-
  All existing prompt compression methods (LLMLingua, LongLLMLingua, LLMLingua-2, Selective-Context, PCRL, Perception Compressor)
  use a SMALL PROXY MODEL (GPT-2, LLaMA-7B, BERT, etc.) to estimate token importance. This creates a distribution mismatch:
  the proxy model's notion of 'important tokens' may not match what the actual target LLM attends to during generation. By
  using the target model's own attention or gradient-based saliency, we directly measure what the target model uses, eliminating
  the proxy gap. This is especially impactful for open models (LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen) where we have full white-box access to
  attention maps.
assumptions:
- >-
  The target LLM's attention patterns or input gradients correlate with token importance for the downstream task
- >-
  White-box access to the target model is available (open-weight models like LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen)
- >-
  Attention-saliency can be computed efficiently (single forward pass or few backward passes) relative to the compression
  budget
- >-
  The target model's attention on the prompt tokens is stable across similar prompts/tasks (enabling caching or reuse)
investigation_approach: >-
  Implement a tiny experiment comparing three compression strategies on LongBench (single-doc QA, multi-doc QA, summarization)
  using LLaMA-3-8B as the target model: (1) LLMLingua (GPT-2 perplexity baseline), (2) LongLLMLingua (query-aware contrastive
  perplexity), (3) Target-Model-Guided: compute attention rollout or integrated gradients from the target model on a calibration
  set, use mean attention-to-prompt or gradient magnitude per token as importance score, compress by retaining top-k tokens.
  Measure F1/ROUGE vs compression ratio. Total compute: <1 GPU-hour on a single A100/H100.
success_criteria: >-
  Target-model-guided compression achieves higher task performance (F1 for QA, ROUGE for summarization) than LLMLingua and
  LongLLMLingua at the same compression ratios (2x, 4x, 8x) on at least 2 of 3 LongBench task categories. A null result (no
  improvement) would still be informative—it would suggest the proxy models already capture the target model's token importance
  well, or that attention-saliency is not the right signal.
related_works:
- >-
  LLMLingua (Jiang et al., EMNLP 2023): Uses GPT-2/LLaMA-7B perplexity as proxy for token importance. Fundamentally differs
  by using a small proxy model instead of the target model's own attention.
- >-
  LongLLMLingua (Jiang et al., ACL 2024): Adds query-awareness via contrastive perplexity (perplexity shift when conditioned
  on question). Still uses a proxy model (LLaMA-7B) for all importance estimates.
- >-
  LLMLingua-2 (Pan et al., ACL Findings 2024): Trains a BERT-based token classifier on GPT-4 distilled data. Task-agnostic,
  uses bidirectional context but still a proxy model (XLM-RoBERTa/mBERT), not the target LLM.
- >-
  Selective-Context (Li et al., 2023): Uses self-information from a small LM. Proxy-based, no query awareness.
- >-
  PCRL (Jung & Kim, 2023): RL-based discrete compression with ROUGE reward. Trains a policy on a small model (DistilBERT),
  not the target LLM.
- >-
  Perception Compressor (Tang et al., NAACL 2025): Training-free, uses guiding questions and contrast perplexity from a small
  LM. Still proxy-based.
- >-
  Attention-based KV cache compression (e.g., Keyformer, PyramidInfer): Uses target model attention to drop KV cache entries
  DURING generation, not for prompt compression BEFORE generation. Different problem setting.
inspiration: >-
  Cross-domain transfer from mechanistic interpretability (attribution patching, activation patching) and model compression
  (attention-guided pruning). In mechanistic interpretability, we routinely use the target model's own attention/activations
  to understand its behavior. In model compression (e.g., MiniLMv2, attention distillation), we use teacher model attention
  to guide student training. The novel move is applying target-model attention/attribution to PROMPT COMPRESSION (selecting
  input tokens) rather than model compression (selecting weights/heads) or KV cache compression (selecting past keys/values).
  This connects the interpretability insight 'the model tells you what it attends to' with the prompt compression problem
  'which input tokens matter'.
terms:
- term: Proxy model
  definition: >-
    A smaller, faster model (e.g., GPT-2, LLaMA-7B, BERT) used to estimate token importance for compressing prompts intended
    for a larger target LLM
- term: Target model
  definition: >-
    The actual LLM that will process the compressed prompt at inference time (e.g., LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, GPT-4)
- term: Attention rollout
  definition: >-
    A method to compute token-to-token attribution by recursively multiplying attention matrices across layers, showing how
    much each input token contributes to each output token
- term: Integrated gradients
  definition: >-
    A gradient-based attribution method that integrates gradients along a straight-line path from a baseline input to the
    actual input, providing token-level importance scores
- term: Attention-saliency map
  definition: >-
    A per-token importance score derived from the target model's attention patterns, e.g., mean attention received by each
    prompt token across heads and layers
- term: Contrastive perplexity
  definition: >-
    LongLLMLingua's metric: perplexity(token | context) - perplexity(token | question, context), measuring how much the question
    reduces uncertainty about a token
summary: >-
  Current prompt compression methods all rely on small proxy models to decide which tokens to keep. This hypothesis proposes
  using the target LLM's own attention-saliency or gradient-based input attribution directly—measuring what the target model
  actually attends to—eliminating the proxy gap. Tiny experiments on LongBench with LLaMA-3-8B can validate this in <1 GPU-hour.
alternates:
- title: Calibration-Set Attention Distillation
  hypothesis: >-
    Instead of computing attention per-query, pre-compute a universal token-importance profile for the target model on a small
    calibration set (e.g., 100 diverse prompts), then use this static profile for all future compressions. This amortizes
    the white-box cost and tests whether the target model has consistent attention patterns across tasks.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If the target model's attention-to-prompt-tokens is relatively stable across tasks (e.g., always attends to instructions,
    entity names, question words), a one-time calibration suffices. This would be dramatically faster than per-query attribution
    and more practical for production. It beats the main hypothesis if per-query computation is the bottleneck and attention
    patterns are task-invariant.
- title: Hybrid Proxy-Target Compression
  hypothesis: >-
    Use the proxy model (e.g., LLMLingua-2) for coarse-grained document/sentence selection (cheap, fast), then apply target-model
    attention-saliency only for fine-grained token selection within the retained segments. This combines the efficiency of
    proxy models with the accuracy of target-model guidance.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    Pure target-model attribution on 10k-token prompts may be slow. Coarse proxy filtering reduces the token budget for expensive
    target-model attribution. This beats the main hypothesis if the compute budget is tight and coarse proxy decisions are
    already near-optimal, leaving only fine-grained selection to benefit from target-model signals.
- title: Gradient-Free Attention Sinks for Black-Box Target Models
  hypothesis: >-
    For API-only target models (no white-box access), use the 'attention sink' phenomenon (first few tokens accumulate disproportionate
    attention) as a proxy for the target model's internal attention: retain tokens that would become attention sinks (early
    instruction tokens, question tokens) and use a small proxy model for the rest.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    The main hypothesis requires white-box access. If the attention sink pattern is universal and predictable, we can approximate
    target-model attention without access. This beats the main hypothesis in black-box settings (OpenAI API, Anthropic API)
    where the main hypothesis is inapplicable. It wins if attention sinks reliably indicate target-model importance across
    diverse prompts.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Target-Model-Guided Prompt Compression via Attention Saliency
hypothesis: >-
  Using the target LLM's own attention-saliency maps or gradient-based input attribution (e.g., integrated gradients, attention
  rollout) to select which prompt tokens to retain will outperform proxy-model-based compression (LLMLingua, LongLLMLingua,
  LLMLingua-2) because it directly captures what the target model actually uses for generation, rather than what a small proxy
  model thinks is important.
motivation: >-
  All existing prompt compression methods (LLMLingua, LongLLMLingua, LLMLingua-2, Selective-Context, PCRL, Perception Compressor)
  use a SMALL PROXY MODEL (GPT-2, LLaMA-7B, BERT, etc.) to estimate token importance. This creates a distribution mismatch:
  the proxy model's notion of 'important tokens' may not match what the actual target LLM attends to during generation. By
  using the target model's own attention or gradient-based saliency, we directly measure what the target model uses, eliminating
  the proxy gap. This is especially impactful for open models (LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen) where we have full white-box access to
  attention maps.
assumptions:
- >-
  The target LLM's attention patterns or input gradients correlate with token importance for the downstream task
- >-
  White-box access to the target model is available (open-weight models like LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen)
- >-
  Attention-saliency can be computed efficiently (single forward pass or few backward passes) relative to the compression
  budget
- >-
  The target model's attention on the prompt tokens is stable across similar prompts/tasks (enabling caching or reuse)
investigation_approach: >-
  Implement a tiny experiment comparing three compression strategies on LongBench (single-doc QA, multi-doc QA, summarization)
  using LLaMA-3-8B as the target model: (1) LLMLingua (GPT-2 perplexity baseline), (2) LongLLMLingua (query-aware contrastive
  perplexity), (3) Target-Model-Guided: compute attention rollout or integrated gradients from the target model on a calibration
  set, use mean attention-to-prompt or gradient magnitude per token as importance score, compress by retaining top-k tokens.
  Measure F1/ROUGE vs compression ratio. Total compute: <1 GPU-hour on a single A100/H100.
success_criteria: >-
  Target-model-guided compression achieves higher task performance (F1 for QA, ROUGE for summarization) than LLMLingua and
  LongLLMLingua at the same compression ratios (2x, 4x, 8x) on at least 2 of 3 LongBench task categories. A null result (no
  improvement) would still be informative—it would suggest the proxy models already capture the target model's token importance
  well, or that attention-saliency is not the right signal.
related_works:
- >-
  LLMLingua (Jiang et al., EMNLP 2023): Uses GPT-2/LLaMA-7B perplexity as proxy for token importance. Fundamentally differs
  by using a small proxy model instead of the target model's own attention.
- >-
  LongLLMLingua (Jiang et al., ACL 2024): Adds query-awareness via contrastive perplexity (perplexity shift when conditioned
  on question). Still uses a proxy model (LLaMA-7B) for all importance estimates.
- >-
  LLMLingua-2 (Pan et al., ACL Findings 2024): Trains a BERT-based token classifier on GPT-4 distilled data. Task-agnostic,
  uses bidirectional context but still a proxy model (XLM-RoBERTa/mBERT), not the target LLM.
- >-
  Selective-Context (Li et al., 2023): Uses self-information from a small LM. Proxy-based, no query awareness.
- >-
  PCRL (Jung & Kim, 2023): RL-based discrete compression with ROUGE reward. Trains a policy on a small model (DistilBERT),
  not the target LLM.
- >-
  Perception Compressor (Tang et al., NAACL 2025): Training-free, uses guiding questions and contrast perplexity from a small
  LM. Still proxy-based.
- >-
  Attention-based KV cache compression (e.g., Keyformer, PyramidInfer): Uses target model attention to drop KV cache entries
  DURING generation, not for prompt compression BEFORE generation. Different problem setting.
inspiration: >-
  Cross-domain transfer from mechanistic interpretability (attribution patching, activation patching) and model compression
  (attention-guided pruning). In mechanistic interpretability, we routinely use the target model's own attention/activations
  to understand its behavior. In model compression (e.g., MiniLMv2, attention distillation), we use teacher model attention
  to guide student training. The novel move is applying target-model attention/attribution to PROMPT COMPRESSION (selecting
  input tokens) rather than model compression (selecting weights/heads) or KV cache compression (selecting past keys/values).
  This connects the interpretability insight 'the model tells you what it attends to' with the prompt compression problem
  'which input tokens matter'.
terms:
- term: Proxy model
  definition: >-
    A smaller, faster model (e.g., GPT-2, LLaMA-7B, BERT) used to estimate token importance for compressing prompts intended
    for a larger target LLM
- term: Target model
  definition: >-
    The actual LLM that will process the compressed prompt at inference time (e.g., LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, GPT-4)
- term: Attention rollout
  definition: >-
    A method to compute token-to-token attribution by recursively multiplying attention matrices across layers, showing how
    much each input token contributes to each output token
- term: Integrated gradients
  definition: >-
    A gradient-based attribution method that integrates gradients along a straight-line path from a baseline input to the
    actual input, providing token-level importance scores
- term: Attention-saliency map
  definition: >-
    A per-token importance score derived from the target model's attention patterns, e.g., mean attention received by each
    prompt token across heads and layers
- term: Contrastive perplexity
  definition: >-
    LongLLMLingua's metric: perplexity(token | context) - perplexity(token | question, context), measuring how much the question
    reduces uncertainty about a token
summary: >-
  Current prompt compression methods all rely on small proxy models to decide which tokens to keep. This hypothesis proposes
  using the target LLM's own attention-saliency or gradient-based input attribution directly—measuring what the target model
  actually attends to—eliminating the proxy gap. Tiny experiments on LongBench with LLaMA-3-8B can validate this in <1 GPU-hour.
alternates:
- title: Calibration-Set Attention Distillation
  hypothesis: >-
    Instead of computing attention per-query, pre-compute a universal token-importance profile for the target model on a small
    calibration set (e.g., 100 diverse prompts), then use this static profile for all future compressions. This amortizes
    the white-box cost and tests whether the target model has consistent attention patterns across tasks.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If the target model's attention-to-prompt-tokens is relatively stable across tasks (e.g., always attends to instructions,
    entity names, question words), a one-time calibration suffices. This would be dramatically faster than per-query attribution
    and more practical for production. It beats the main hypothesis if per-query computation is the bottleneck and attention
    patterns are task-invariant.
- title: Hybrid Proxy-Target Compression
  hypothesis: >-
    Use the proxy model (e.g., LLMLingua-2) for coarse-grained document/sentence selection (cheap, fast), then apply target-model
    attention-saliency only for fine-grained token selection within the retained segments. This combines the efficiency of
    proxy models with the accuracy of target-model guidance.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    Pure target-model attribution on 10k-token prompts may be slow. Coarse proxy filtering reduces the token budget for expensive
    target-model attribution. This beats the main hypothesis if the compute budget is tight and coarse proxy decisions are
    already near-optimal, leaving only fine-grained selection to benefit from target-model signals.
- title: Gradient-Free Attention Sinks for Black-Box Target Models
  hypothesis: >-
    For API-only target models (no white-box access), use the 'attention sink' phenomenon (first few tokens accumulate disproportionate
    attention) as a proxy for the target model's internal attention: retain tokens that would become attention sinks (early
    instruction tokens, question tokens) and use a small proxy model for the rest.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    The main hypothesis requires white-box access. If the attention sink pattern is universal and predictable, we can approximate
    target-model attention without access. This beats the main hypothesis in black-box settings (OpenAI API, Anthropic API)
    where the main hypothesis is inapplicable. It wins if attention sinks reliably indicate target-model importance across
    diverse prompts.

  Execute the wide screen: run all 4 candidate methods on the LongBench mini-split, compute F1 (QA) and ROUGE-L (summarization)
  at 2x/4x/8x compression, produce ranked comparison with pre-registered selection rule.
approach: >-
  Implement a single evaluation harness that: (a) loads LLaMA-3-8B (4-bit quantized for memory) and all compression method
  implementations; (b) for each method and each compression ratio, compresses each mini-split example's prompt; (c) runs target

  (BERT classifier), M4=Target-Attention (attention rollout per-query), M5=Calibration-Distilled (static profile from 100
  prompts), M6=Hybrid (LLMLingua-2 coarse + Target-Attention fine), M7=Attention-Sink (first-k + proxy). Pre-registered selection

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.
