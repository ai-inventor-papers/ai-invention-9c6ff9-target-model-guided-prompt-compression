## Task: `gen_viz_1` (sdk_openhands_agent)

### [1] SYSTEM-USER prompt · 2026-09-21 00:42:56 UTC

<task>
Generate a publication-quality figure for a top-tier venue research paper that exactly follows the provided specification.

Use the aii-concept-fig-gen skill to generate the figure in the aspect ratio from the spec. ALWAYS pass `--model flash --style neurips` to EVERY concept_fig_gen.py call (this run uses the **flash** Gemini image tier). `--style neurips` appends the paper style — white background, sans-serif labels, no 3D or shadows or gradients — so the tool carries it on every call instead of you having to remember it in every prompt. Be as detailed as possible in your image generation prompt: include all data values, axis labels, ranges, legend entries, preferred colors, and describe where each element should be positioned. Then END the prompt with a separate sentence listing the words that must appear, verbatim — "The boxes read Tokenizer, Transformer, Classifier." Naming them inside the layout sentence instead is what turns Encoder into `Enc:der`; every measured run that stated them as their own closing sentence spelled all of them correctly, and word length made no difference either way.

IMPORTANT — Two-phase workflow: explore cheaply at 1K, then finalize at 2K. Create a subfolder `fig1_all/` in your workspace for ALL attempts.

PHASE 1 — Explore at 1K (HARD LIMIT: 5 attempts):
- Generate at `--model flash --image-size 1K` (fast and cheap). Save attempts as `fig1_all/fig1_v0_it1.jpg`, `fig1_all/fig1_v0_it2.jpg`, … up to `_it5.jpg`.
- After EACH attempt, read the image back and verify it against the checklist below. If it has issues, regenerate with a corrected prompt.
- Do AT MOST 5 generations in this phase — stop early as soon as one is clean. Then pick the single best 1K attempt (the "chosen base").

PHASE 2 — Finalize at 2K (EXACTLY 2 upscale passes of the chosen base):
- Run EXACTLY TWO generations at `--model flash --image-size 2K`, each in edit mode passing the chosen base as the input image (`--edit` the chosen base .jpg). Instruct it to upscale and sharpen while preserving the exact layout, data values, labels, and composition — and to fix any remaining issues from the checklist.
- Save them as `fig1_all/fig1_v0_2k_1.jpg` and `fig1_all/fig1_v0_2k_2.jpg`.
- Read both back, verify both, and choose the better of the two as the final figure.
- IF THE GENERATOR REFUSES EDIT MODE — on a $0 run the free image provider has no
  edit endpoint at all, and the tool says so ("the free image variant cannot edit
  an existing image") before spending anything — then SKIP this phase entirely and
  deliver the best PHASE 1 attempt. Do NOT pass `--paid` to get around it: that puts
  paid image spend on a run chosen to be free, which is the single largest line item
  a "free" run has ever been billed.

DELIVERABLE:
- Copy the chosen final image to your workspace root as: fig1_v0.jpg — the
  chosen 2K upscale when phase 2 ran, and the chosen 1K attempt when it could not.
- The file `fig1_v0.jpg` is the deliverable — everything in `fig1_all/` is reference only.

Verification checklist (apply after EVERY generation in BOTH phases). Check for:
- Layout issues (e.g. text too close together, figure looks cluttered, elements crammed into corners)
- Overlapping or touching labels, legends, or annotations
- Cut-off or truncated text, axis labels, or titles
- Wrong or missing data values, bars, lines, or data points
- Incorrect axis ranges, tick marks, or scales
- Missing or misplaced legend entries
- Blurry text, unreadable font sizes, or poor contrast
- Wrong font family (MUST be sans-serif like Helvetica/Arial — reject any serif fonts like Times New Roman)
- MISSPELLED labels. Read every word in the image letter by letter against the word you asked for. This is the most common defect by a wide margin — `erooder` for Encoder, `routter` for Router, `conveged?` for converged? — and it is the one that survives a glance, because the shape of the word is right
- Invented text you never asked for. A prompt ending "no text of any kind" came back lettered with `Kat q` and fake axis ticks, so absence has to be checked too, not assumed
- A box, arrow or panel that is duplicated, missing, or pointing nowhere, even when every word in the image is spelled correctly

In Phase 1, if ANY issue is found — even minor — do another attempt (within the 5-attempt limit). Do NOT accept a figure with problems as the chosen base.

Change the prompt only when the prompt is what was wrong — a word you never specified, an element you forgot to name. For a defect the prompt already rules out, re-run it UNCHANGED: the same prompt sent twice gave a correct three-box chain once and four boxes with one label repeated the other time. Rewriting a prompt that was already right spends one of five attempts on a variable that was not the cause.

<figure_specification>
Figure ID: fig1
Title: System Architecture
Caption: Pipeline for target-model-guided prompt compression. The target LLM's attention maps are computed via attention rollout, and tokens are ranked by aggregated attention flow to the first generated token.
Image Generation Description: Horizontal flow diagram, left to right. Five labeled boxes: 'Input Prompt' (gray), 'Target LLM (GPT-2)' (blue), 'Attention Matrices (12 layers x 12 heads)' (light blue, narrow), 'Attention Rollout (matrix product + identity)' (green), 'Token Importance Scores' (orange). Arrows labeled with tensor shapes. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.
Aspect Ratio: 21:9
Summary: Architecture diagram showing attention rollout pipeline
</figure_specification>

<critical_requirements>
1. Accurately represent ALL data values described above — include every number mentioned
2. Do NOT invent additional data points beyond what is described
3. Include clear axis labels only if the figure has axes (not for diagrams/flowcharts)
4. FONT: ALL text MUST use sans-serif font (Helvetica/Arial). NO serif fonts (Times New Roman). Always include "Sans-serif font throughout (Helvetica/Arial style, NOT Times New Roman)" in your image generation prompt. This is the #1 most common issue — check it first during verification
5. Publication camera-ready style: white backgrounds, properly formatted axes, no 3D effects/shadows/gradients. Follow aii-concept-fig-gen skill for image generation, prompting best practices, and figure type templates
6. TEXT SPACING: Ensure generous spacing between ALL text labels. Labels MUST NOT overlap or touch. Use large readable font sizes (minimum 12pt equivalent). If labels would overlap, stagger them vertically, use leader lines, or abbreviate. For multi-panel figures, add clear padding between panels
7. RESOLUTION: Explore at 1K (Phase 1), then finalize with two 2K upscale passes of the chosen base (Phase 2) — see the two-phase workflow above. Do NOT use 4K. For multi-panel or detail-heavy figures, use wider aspect ratios to give elements room
8. MANDATORY VERIFICATION: After EVERY generation attempt, read the image and check font first (sans-serif?), then layout, data accuracy, and readability. If anything is wrong, regenerate. Do NOT stop at the first attempt

STOP. You have reached the maximum number of turns.

Do NOT use any more tools. Finish what you are doing and provide your final output NOW.

Use whatever information you have gathered so far to produce the best response possible.
